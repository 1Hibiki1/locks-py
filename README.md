# Locks

Locks is an imperative, dynamically typed, procedure oriented scripting language which is based on the [lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) programming language. It is a work in progress.

## Usage

Note: You will need to have python 3 installed. This project was tested with python 3.8.3.

To start the editor, clone this repo and run

``` console
python locks-editor.py
```

An editor window should pop up. Start coding! You can find examples at `examples/`.

You can run a lox program by using the interpreter as:

``` console
python locks-interpreter.py <locks-filename>
```

or through the editor: Run => Run (from the menubar).
